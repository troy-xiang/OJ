 * 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
 * (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
 * (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
